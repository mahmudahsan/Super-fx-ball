## Development
CLDC 1.0 &amp; MIDP 2.0

I developed this game in 2007 by Java for J2ME platform. At that time I had Nokia Phone which supports J2ME. At that time J2ME was quite popular. I was a student of computer science when I built this game. Recently I thought lets share the code with other people if it helps them.

I used NetBeans IDE to develop and build the game.
